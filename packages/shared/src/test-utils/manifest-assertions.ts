/**
 * Assertion helpers for MCP tool manifests.
 *
 * These assertions pin the `system-architecture.md` §24.3 description
 * contract — the "Tool descriptions are agent prompts" discipline
 * that makes `tools/list` output agent-directable without a human in
 * the loop. Every tool manifest that lands in the ContextOS monorepo
 * (the eight `contextos__*` tools in Module 02, any future tool in
 * downstream packages) should route its manifest test through
 * `assertManifestDescriptionValid` so the §24.3 rules stay uniform
 * across packages and cannot drift per-tool.
 *
 * Consumed from:
 *   - `apps/mcp-server/__tests__/unit/tools/*.test.ts`
 *   - any future `@coodra/contextos-tools-*` package's manifest tests
 *
 * Kept in `@coodra/contextos-shared/test-utils` (subpath export) rather than
 * inlined in the mcp-server because:
 *   1. §24.3 is a protocol rule, not a server-implementation detail.
 *   2. Future tool packages shipped outside `apps/mcp-server/` need the
 *      same check without pulling the server package as a dev dep.
 *   3. One file, one contract, one failure message when §24.3 evolves.
 *
 * This module is test-utility code — it may use `assert`-style throws
 * because the only caller is a unit test that wants a readable diff
 * on failure.
